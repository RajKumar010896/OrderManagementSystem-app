# OrderManagementSystem-app
 The "Order Management System" is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the management of customer orders for a food service establishment. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:  Main Frame:  The main frame serves as the primary interface for customers to place orders. It includes text fields for entering customer details such as name, phone number, email, and delivery address. Customers can select items from a menu using checkboxes. There are buttons for submitting orders and clearing fields. Database Connectivity:  The application connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve order information. It uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database communication. Order Submission:  Upon submitting an order, the application validates customer input and processes the order. Validation includes checking for empty fields, valid phone numbers, and non-negative quantities. Selected items and their quantities are saved to the database along with customer details. Admin Login Panel:  An admin login panel is provided for accessing administrative features. Admin credentials are hardcoded (for demonstration purposes) but can be replaced with a more secure authentication system. After successful login, the admin panel opens, providing access to view and delete orders. Admin Panel:  The admin panel displays a list of orders fetched from the database. Admins can view details of each order, including customer information, selected items, and quantities. There's an option to delete orders by specifying the order ID. Database Interaction:  The application interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on orders. Order details are stored in the database, allowing for easy retrieval and management. User Input Validation:  The application validates user input to ensure data integrity and prevent errors. Error messages are displayed to users if input validation fails. UI Customization:  The user interface (UI) is designed with a sky blue background and organized layout for ease of use. Error Handling:  The application includes error handling mechanisms to deal with database connection issues, input validation errors, and other potential problems. Overall, the "Order Management System" provides a user-friendly interface for customers to place orders and allows administrators to manage orders efficiently through an admin panel. It streamlines the process of order handling and database management for food service businesses.
